                Digital citizenship workshop encompasses a broad range of skills and responsibilities required for individuals to navigate the digital world safely and ethically. I was given the opportunity to become one of those ALS-Implementers to be trained for this workshop, so that I can apply it to our learners who doesn’t have any knowledge about digital world. I was been trained for almost 10 days to be more knowledgeable about the digital world. 
                    The facilitator of this workshop was all fully equipped and knowledgeable with what they are teaching, they utilize teaching methods to engage participants effectively. Actual activities or hands on activities are more implemented so that we can directly understand the flow of the lessons. Participant’s involvement was key indicator of the workshop’s success. The open, inclusive atmosphere facilitated meaningful discussions and ensured that everyone felt heard and valued. Feedback collected at the end of every session. 
                    Through this workshop I learned a lot of things that was all been knew for me in terms of digital world, the technique in presenting reports, making reports and even making a simple web page was been taught to us. I was been thankful that I became part of this program. I am well assured today that I am fully equipped of having knowledge about digital citizenship.
